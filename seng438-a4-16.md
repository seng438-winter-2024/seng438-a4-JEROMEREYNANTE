# Introduction
This lab introduces Mutation and GUI testing and involves the use of PITests and Selenium. It also allows us to familiarize ourselves with mutation coverage, detecting equivalent mutants, and improving mutation score.

In section 2, our group is meant to use our test cases made for previous assignments to check our existing mutation score and add/improve test cases to increase mutation score by at least 10% for Range and DataUtilities.
For Section 3, we created Selenium test scripts to test existing and popular website GUIs. We also compared Selenium to another GUI testing tool called Sikulix.

Our initial knowledge of Mutation and GUI testing came from content covered in lectures. The lectures explained that Mutation testing focuses on manipulating source code and introducing mutants, which are bugs inserted to hopefully cause errors. Then you use your existing test suite to evaluate mutation coverage and add/improve tests to increase mutation coverage. 

GUI testing can be used to test websites and application GUIs to ensure proper functionality, state, and behaviour. Requirements of a GUI testing tool are that it records user interactions and replays test scripts, but these tools can also include optional benefits such as editing test scripts and inserting your own validation points. 

# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 
| Mutation Number | Method | Mutation | Killed/Survived | How the Mutation Was Killed or Not by Original Test Suite |
|-----------------|--------|----------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1               | getUpperBound | Incremented (a++) double field upper | SURVIVED | Survived because we need to try calling getUpperBound 2 times in a row |
| 2               | getUpperBound | Incremented (++a) double field upper | KILLED | Killed because operator is pre-increment and change to upper is immediate |
| 3               | getLowerBound | Incremented (a++) double field lower | SURVIVED | Survived because we need to try calling getLowerBound 2 times in a row |
| 4               | getLength       | Decremented (a--) double field lower         | SURVIVED       | Survived because we need to try calling the getLength 2 times in a row                                                          |
| 5               | getLowerBound | Decremented (--a) double field lower|KILLED| Killed because operator is pre-decrement and change to lower is immediate |
| 6               | getLength       | Decremented (a--) double field upper         | SURVIVED       | Survived because we need to try calling the getLength 2 times in a row                                                          |
| 7               | getLength       | Decremented (--a) double field lower         | KILLED       | Killed because operator is pre-decrement and change to lower is immediate                                                          |
| 8               | contains | negated conditional | KILLED | Killed because assertions will detect negation of condition |
| 9               | getCentralValue       | Decremented (a--) double field lower         | SURVIVED       | Survived because we need to try calling getCentralValue 2 times in a row                                                          |

# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class

<img src="./media/10-PIT-Test-Statistics.png" width=75% height=75%/>

Mutation score formula = ( mutations killed / total mutations ) * 100

**Mutation score for DataUtilities = 46%** <br/>
**Mutation score for Range = 12%** <br/>

# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes
Our test suite from previous assignments performs ok for mutation coverage considering the number of methods we tested to the number of methods that exist. Many methods don't get tested, which will certainly hurt the mutation score. If we add test cases to cover these untested methods, we can easily improve mutation coverage and increase both classes' effectiveness. 

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

Equivalent mutants hurt the mutation score accuracy because these mutations cannot be effectively covered. Since they can't be covered and always survive, they will always decrease the mutation score.

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

To improve mutation score, we can add test cases for methods which have never been tested. This technique is sure to improve mutation score drastically. We can also add and improve test cases to catch more intricate mutations which end up surviving.

Test Cases Added for DataUtilities
- `testEqual_NominalCase`
- `testEqual_BothNull`
- `testEqual_TestAisNull`
- `testEqual_TestBisNull`
- `testEqual_DifferentLengths`
- `testEqual_SameLengthDifferentElements`
- `testClone_NominalCase`

**New Mutation Score = 68%**

### Discuss in your report the test cases that you had to add to increase the mutation score, and also how you designed them.
Since methods that weren't tested had no mutation coverage, it made sense to add test cases for these methods which would most definitely increase the overall mutation coverage. 

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing
Mutation testing is crucial because it is designed to ensure the quality of the software by conducting unit test. For instance, creating new test cases that wasn't covered or introduces faults increases the mutation coverage. 

Advantages of using mutation testing
- has the ability to detect failures in the code
- Improved Software Quality
- Loopholes in test data can be identified
Disadvantages of using mutaiton testing
- Difficult to implement due to the fact that it might not increase mutation coverage
- Large programs need to be tested against the original test suite

# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process (WILL COME BACK TO THIS LATER??)
We split the work to test each gui test cases for 3 different website. We noticed that we have different number of failures for our test cases. 

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints
- Assertions are rules that the response must meet to pass the test. While checkpoints are points in the test to compare response with a baseline or expected value.

# how did you test each functionaity with different test data


# Discuss advantages and disadvantages of Selenium vs. Sikulix
Advantages of Selenium
- Supports Language and Framework Support
- It's Open Source
- Easy to Implement
- Offers Flexibility
- Resuability
Disadvantages of Selenium
- Has limited support for desktop applications and mobile testing
- Does not support image-based testing
- Limited control over network activities
- Requires built-in reporting capabilities
- Requires latest updates and maintenance to create accurate test cases

Advantages of Sikulix
- Simple to automate windows application
- Allows to check and interact the appearance of the image
- Easily to automate Flash objects
- It's an open source tool
- Allows for quick automation script development

Disadvantage of Sikulix
- Reduces performance when testing image recognition
- GUI Maintenance can impact scripts
- Requires frequent updates to maintain stability
- Requires skill as it relies on image recognition and scripting.
- As you execute scripts over extended durations, it becomes imperative to exercise caution in handling errors effectively.


# How the team work/effort was divided and managed
Me and Karam went through the mutation test and analyze the mutants, coverage, and then reccorded in the report. We added some test cases to improve the coverage by 10%. For the gui testing, we split the work to create test cases in each website. Then we ran all of the test cases to ensure failure and pass.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned
We were having difficulties with using the Pitest. For this reason, it depends on which java version you're using. I know some of my team members are using Java 1.8 while others are using Java 1.6. Using Selenium is easy to use since you can record all the test cases and run it to see if there are any failues.

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
In general, the lab is straightforward, revolving around executing pitest and logging variables, along with utilizing Selenium for GUI test cases. The most challenging aspect lies in enhancing test coverage for DatautilitiesTest and RangeTest. This requires devising novel test cases distinct from the existing test suite.
