### Note: All of these would be easily killed if Range had a method to set upper and lower bounds.

- #### getLowerBound()
    - Survived Mutations:
        - 5.Decremented (a--) double field lower → SURVIVED

- #### getUpperBound()
    - Survived Mutations:
        - 4.Incremented (a++) double field upper → SURVIVED

- #### getLegnth()
    - Survived Mutations:
        - 12.Killed by : none Incremented (a++) double field upper → SURVIVED
        - 13.Incremented (a++) double field lower → SURVIVED
        - 14.Decremented (a--) double field upper → SURVIVED
        - 15.Decremented (a--) double field lower → SURVIVED

- #### getCentralValue()
    - Survived Mutations:
        - 40.Incremented (a++) double field lower → SURVIVED
        - 41.Incremented (a++) double field upper → SURVIVED
        - 42.Decremented (a--) double field lower → SURVIVED
        - 43.Decremented (a--) double field upper → SURVIVED

- #### contains()
    - Survived Mutations:
        - 21.Substituted 1 with -1 → SURVIVED
        - 23.Substituted 1 with -1 → SURVIVED
        - 40.Incremented (a++) double local variable number 1 → SURVIVED
